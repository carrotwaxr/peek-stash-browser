# Docker Image Optimization Summary

## Overview

Optimized the production Docker image build process to improve efficiency, security, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dockerfile.production Optimizations

**Node Version Update**
- Upgraded from `node:18-slim` to `node:22-slim`
- Benefits: Latest LTS, improved performance, security patches, better npm performance

**Build Process Improvements**
- Changed from `npm install` to `npm ci` for reproducible builds
- Added `--no-audit --prefer-offline` flags to speed up builds
- Production stage now uses `--omit=dev` to exclude development dependencies
- Better layer ordering for improved caching (package.json before source code)

**Multi-Stage Build Optimization**
- Frontend build stage: Minimal dependencies, clean build
- Backend build stage: Includes build tools (python3, make, g++) only in build stage
- Production stage: Only runtime dependencies (no build tools)
- Each stage optimized independently

**External Configuration Files**
- Extracted inline nginx config to `docker/nginx.conf`
- Extracted inline startup script to `docker/start.sh`
- Benefits: Better maintainability, easier to modify, cleaner Dockerfile

**Runtime Optimizations**
- Added `--no-install-recommends` to apt-get to minimize installed packages
- Combined RUN commands to reduce layers
- Added healthcheck for container monitoring
- Set `NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048"` for better memory management
- Added curl for healthcheck support

### 2. .dockerignore Enhancements

**Comprehensive Exclusions**
- Development files (test files, coverage, .vscode, .idea)
- Documentation files (*.md except critical ones)
- Build artifacts (node_modules, dist, build)
- Git files and metadata
- CI/CD configuration files
- IDE and editor temporary files
- Runtime data directories

**Pattern Improvements**
- Added glob patterns for test files (`**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*`)
- Excluded config files not needed in image (`tsconfig*.json`, `.eslintrc*`)
- Preserved only essential files (kept `server/tsconfig.json`)

### 3. New Configuration Files

**docker/nginx.conf**
- Clean nginx configuration for serving frontend and proxying backend
- Added `proxy_http_version 1.1` and `Connection ""` for better HTTP/1.1 support
- Proper cache headers for static assets

**docker/start.sh**
- Improved startup script with error handling (`set -e`)
- Added echo statements for better logging during container startup
- Used `exec` for proper signal handling

## Build Results

**Final Image Size**: 1.57GB

This is reasonable for a full-stack application including:
- Node.js runtime
- FFmpeg with all codecs and multimedia libraries
- Nginx web server
- SQLite
- React frontend (pre-built)
- Backend application with all dependencies

## Performance Improvements

1. **Build Time**: Better caching reduces rebuild time when only source code changes
2. **Security**: Latest Node version, fewer installed packages, no dev dependencies
3. **Maintainability**: Separate config files easier to update
4. **Reliability**: `npm ci` ensures reproducible builds, healthcheck monitors container health

## Testing

Build tested and verified:
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.production -t peek-stash-browser:optimized .
```

Image size: 1.57GB

## Next Steps

To further reduce image size (optional future work):
1. Consider Alpine base image (requires testing with native modules)
2. Multi-architecture builds for ARM support
3. Analyze and potentially remove unused FFmpeg codecs
4. Consider distroless final image (advanced)

## Recommendations

1. Test the optimized image in production-like environment
2. Run security scan: `docker scan peek-stash-browser:optimized`
3. Monitor container health via healthcheck endpoint
4. Update deployment documentation with new build commands
