  # Integration tests require access to a Stash test instance on the local network.
  # This job only runs on self-hosted runners with network access to the test server.
  # To enable: add a self-hosted runner on the same network as the Stash test instance,
  # configure STASH_TEST_URL and STASH_TEST_API_KEY as repository secrets,
  # and change 'if: false' to 'if: true' (or use a different condition).
