description: Push changes to remote and produce a PR title and description
---

Review all the commits made in this branch and create a meaningful PR title and description. Follow these guidelines:

1. Push to remote
2. Summarize the nature of changes (new feature, enhancement, bug fix, refactoring, etc.)
3. Focus on the "why" rather than just the "what"
4. Keep each item concise but descriptive (1-2 sentences). You may be able to use commit messages directly
5. Provide a meaningful PR title and description, in markdown format inside of a code block so that the user can copy and paste directly into Github's Web UI
