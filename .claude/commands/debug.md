description: Debug an unexpected behavior
---

I've noticed a bug or unexpected behavior. Please:

1. Read any context or information the user provides about the issue
2. Check recent commits for possible clues
3. Find and read through the relevant code blocks and their imports/references. No guessing
4. Explain what's happening and recommend fixes. Provide supporting evidence for your theory, adding temporary debug logging to the app if needed.
5. Confirm expected behavior of latest requested change, or troubleshoot and continue to try to achieve the objective
6. Be concise and actionable
7. Do not commit until the user confirms
