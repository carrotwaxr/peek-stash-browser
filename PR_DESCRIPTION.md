## Major Features

### 1. Per-User Ratings & Favorites System

**Complete implementation of per-user ratings and favorites:**

#### Database Schema (Prisma)
- `SceneRating` model (sceneId, userId, rating, favorite, createdAt, updatedAt)
- `PerformerRating` model (performerId, userId, rating, favorite)
- `StudioRating` model (studioId, userId, rating, favorite)
- `TagRating` model (tagId, userId, rating, favorite)
- Unique constraints on (entityId, userId) pairs

#### Backend API
- `POST /api/ratings/scene` - Create/update scene rating
- `POST /api/ratings/performer` - Create/update performer rating
- `POST /api/ratings/studio` - Create/update studio rating
- `POST /api/ratings/tag` - Create/update tag rating
- Rating injection in all library endpoints (findScenes, findPerformers, findStudios, findTags)
- Favorite filtering support for all entity types
- Rating sorting support for all entity types

#### Frontend UI
- `RatingControls.jsx` - Interactive star rating component with favorite toggle
- Integrated into scene cards, performer cards, studio cards, tag cards
- Integrated into video player controls
- Hover preview for half-star ratings
- Real-time updates without page refresh
- Click propagation prevention to avoid navigation conflicts

#### Features
- **Filtering by favorites** - ‚úÖ checkbox for all entity types
- **Filtering by rating** - Min/max range sliders for all entity types
- **Combined filters** - Intersection logic (favorite + rating filters work together)
- **Sorting by rating** - ASC/DESC for all entity types
- **Per-user O counter** - Peek tracks per-user O counts, not Stash global counts
- **No sync to Stash** - Ratings/favorites are Peek-only (documented policy)

### 2. Performance Optimization & Caching

**In-memory caching infrastructure with dramatic performance improvements:**

#### Caching System
- NodeCache with 1-hour TTL for Stash entities
- Separate caches for Stash data and user ratings
- ~55 MB memory footprint for full library (50K scenes, 20K performers)
- Automatic cache expiration and stats logging every 30 minutes
- Cache hit/miss logging for debugging

#### Performance Improvements
- **Before:** 15-20s for scenes rating sort (every request)
- **After:** 10-15s first load, <500ms subsequent requests (97% faster)
- **Before:** 2-3 minutes for full Stash sync
- **After:** 30-60 seconds with GraphQL filtering (70% faster)

**Commits:**
- `14aa0d4` - perf: Add in-memory caching for Stash entity queries
- `00afc9a` - fix: Add missing caching for scenes rating sort and performers o_counter sort
- `4730198` - fix: TypeScript errors in sync and add cache infrastructure

---

### 3. Stash Media Proxy (Public Access)

**Server-side proxy for media files that hides API keys:**

#### Features
- Public endpoint: `/api/proxy/stash?path=/scene/123/screenshot`
- Supports images (JPEG, PNG, WebP), sprites, VTT files
- Streams media with proper cache headers (1-year immutable)
- No authentication required (enables public sharing)
- Hides Stash API keys from client browsers

#### Use Cases
- Share individual scene screenshots publicly
- Embed Peek images in external sites
- Browse Peek without Stash credentials
- Reverse proxy setups (Nginx, Caddy, etc.)

**Commits:**
- `b33c747` - feat: Add Stash media proxy to hide API keys from clients

  - Scenes: Rating only, Favorite only, Both, or All
  - Performers: Rating only, Favorite only, Both, or All
  - Studios: Rating only, Favorite only, Both, or All
  - Tags: Favorite only or All
- GraphQL filtering reduces data transfer by 70-80%
- Example: 21K scenes ‚Üí ~4.5K rated scenes transferred
- Progress reporting with created/updated/checked counts
- Automatic cache invalidation after sync

**Commits:**
- `7ac5c9a` - feat: Add one-way Stash sync with selective import

### 2.2: Scenes Rating Sort (Cache Hit)
1. Click sort direction to switch to ASC
2. **‚è±Ô∏è Expected:** <500ms (instant - uses cached data)
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs peek-server --tail=50 | grep -i cache`
4. **Expected log:** `Cache hit - using cached scenes for rating sort {"count":21218}`

### 2.3: Pagination with Cache
1. Navigate to page 2, 3, etc.
2. **‚è±Ô∏è Expected:** <500ms per page (instant - all pages use same cache)

6. **‚è±Ô∏è Flip:** <500ms (cache hit)

### 2.5: Verify ASC Sorting (Bug Fix)
1. Sort Performers by O Count ASC
2. First page shows performers with o_counter = 0
3. Navigate to LAST page
4. **Expected:** Performers with highest o_counter values (not zeros)
5. **Bug Fix:** Before fix, ASC showed zeros on last page (incorrect)

### 2.6: Cache Expiration
1. Wait 1 hour ‚è∞ (or restart: `docker-compose restart peek-server`)
2. Sort scenes by Rating again
3. **‚è±Ô∏è Expected:** 10-15 seconds (cache miss - re-fetches from Stash)
4. Check logs for "Cache miss"

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ First load: 10-15s for scenes, 5-10s for performers (populates cache)
- ‚úÖ Sort flip: <500ms (97% faster)
- ‚úÖ Pagination: <500ms (instant)
- ‚úÖ Logs show "Cache hit" for subsequent requests

6. **Bug Fix:** Before fix, ID fields weren't parsed as integers

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Filter chips display for all filter types
- ‚úÖ Multi-select shows "X selected"
- ‚úÖ Chips removable via X button
- ‚úÖ URL parameters persist filters across page loads
- ‚úÖ ID fields parsed as integers (not strings)

## Performance Benchmarks

**Before this PR:**
| Operation | Time |
|-----------|------|
| Scenes rating sort (first load) | 15-20s |
| Scenes rating sort (flip direction) | 15-20s |
| Performers o_count sort | 10-15s |
| Sync all entities | 2-3 minutes |
| Image loading | Requires Stash network access |

**After this PR:**
| Operation | Time | Improvement |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Scenes rating sort (first load) | 10-15s | ~25% faster |
| Scenes rating sort (flip direction) | <500ms | **97% faster** |
| Performers o_count sort (first load) | 5-10s | ~33% faster |
| Performers o_count sort (flip direction) | <500ms | **97% faster** |
| Sync all entities | 30-60s | **70% faster** |
| Image loading | Works without Stash access | **Enables public access** |

## Memory Usage

**Cache Memory Footprint (1-hour window):**
- 50K scenes: ~45 MB
- 20K performers: ~4 MB
- 2K studios: ~0.4 MB
- 2K tags: ~0.2 MB
- User ratings (10 users): ~3.3 MB
- **Total: ~55 MB** (acceptable for Docker container)

**Monitor memory:**
```bash
docker stats peek-stash-browser-peek-server-1
```

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This is a backward-compatible enhancement.

**Existing functionality:**
- ‚úÖ All existing features continue to work
- ‚úÖ API responses unchanged (URLs transformed server-side)
- ‚úÖ Client code requires no changes
- ‚úÖ Database migrations automatic (Prisma)

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are found:

1. **Revert the PR:**
   ```bash
   git revert <merge-commit-sha>
   git push origin master
   ```

2. **Or use previous Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker pull carrotwaxr/peek-stash-browser:previous-version
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

**No data migration required** - Caching is in-memory only, ratings stored in SQLite.

## Debugging Commands

**Check logs:**
```bash
docker-compose logs peek-server --tail=200
```

**Look for errors:**
```bash
docker-compose logs peek-server | grep -i "error"
```

**Check cache activity:**
```bash
docker-compose logs peek-server | grep -i "cache"
```

**Verify proxy requests:**
```bash
docker-compose logs peek-server | grep -i "proxy"
```

**Monitor sync progress:**
```bash
docker-compose logs peek-server | grep -i "sync"
```

## Next Steps

After testing and merging:

1. **Squash commits** (optional - 52 commits may be too granular)
2. **Update version** in package.json (both client and server)
3. **Create git tag** (e.g., `v1.1.0`)
4. **Push tag** to trigger Docker build and release
5. **Users update** via `docker pull` and restart

Enjoy the massive improvements! üöÄ
