## What's New

### 1. Server Statistics Dashboard üìä

Real-time monitoring UI showing server health and performance metrics.

**Features:**

- **System Resources** - Uptime, CPU cores, memory usage with color-coded progress bars
- **Cache Statistics** - Entity counts, cache size, initialization status, last refresh time
- **Database Info** - SQLite file size tracking
- **Transcoding Sessions** - Active session monitoring with session details table (Scene ID, Quality, Age, Status)

---

### 2. Per-User Ratings & Favorites ‚≠ê

Complete rating system allowing users to rate and favorite all entity types with full filtering and sorting support.

**Database Schema:**

- Per-user rating tables for Scenes, Performers, Studios, Tags

- Unique constraints on (entityId, userId) pairs

**UI Components:**

- Interactive star rating component with hover preview

- **Combined filters** - Intersection logic (favorite AND rating work together)
- **Sort by rating** - ASC/DESC on all entity types
- **Peek-side processing** - Rating filters don't go to Stash (handled locally)

**Per-User O Counter:**

- Peek tracks per-user O counts (not Stash global counts)
- Display on performer cards (üí¶ icon with count)
- Read-only display on cards
- Interactive increment in video player

**Stash Integration:**

- **No sync to Stash** - Ratings/favorites are Peek-only (documented policy)
- **One-way import** - Can import Stash ratings during sync
- **Preserves Stash data** - Peek doesn't modify Stash ratings

---

### 3. Performance & Caching System ‚ö°

In-memory caching infrastructure delivering 97% performance improvement on repeat queries.

**Implementation:**

- NodeCache with 1-hour TTL
- Separate caches for Stash data and user ratings
- ~55 MB memory footprint for full library (50K scenes, 20K performers)
- Automatic expiration with stats logging every 30 minutes
- Cache hit/miss logging for debugging

**Performance Results:**

| Operation | Before | After | Improvement |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Scenes rating sort (first) | 15-20s | 10-15s | ~25% faster |
| Scenes rating sort (repeat) | 15-20s | <500ms | **97% faster** ‚ö° |
| Performers O count (first) | 10-15s | 5-10s | ~33% faster |
| Performers O count (repeat) | 10-15s | <500ms | **97% faster** ‚ö° |
| Stash sync | 2-3 min | 30-60s | **70% faster** ‚ö° |

**Visibility:**

- Cache statistics in Server Statistics dashboard
- Real-time monitoring of cache size and hit rates

### 6. Video Player Improvements üé•

Major video player enhancements including architecture refactor, dynamic aspect ratios, and faster transcoding cleanup.

**Modular Architecture Refactor:**

- **VideoPlayerContext** - Centralized state management for player
- **Custom Hooks:**
  - `useVideoPlayer.js` - Core Video.js integration
  - `usePlaybackTracking.js` - Watch history and O counter tracking
  - `usePlaylistNavigation.js` - Playlist next/prev/autoplay logic
  - `useOrientationFullscreen.js` - Mobile fullscreen on orientation change
- **Video.js Plugin Integration** - Quality selector plugin
- **Modular, testable code** - Separation of concerns

**Dynamic Aspect Ratios:**

- Calculates aspect ratio from actual video dimensions (width/height)
- Supports all formats:
  - 16:9 widescreen (most common)
  - 4:3 standard (pillarboxed with black bars on sides)
  - 9:16 portrait (vertical videos, letterboxed)
  - Any custom ratio
- Max-width 1920px with centering on ultra-wide displays
- No more stretched or cut-off videos

**Transcoding Cleanup:**

- Reduced session timeout from 30 minutes to 90 seconds
- Sessions kept alive by segment requests during playback
- When user navigates away, FFmpeg stops after 90s of inactivity
- Prevents orphaned processes consuming server resources

### 7. Stash Media Proxy üîí

Server-side proxy for media files that hides Stash API keys from clients, enabling public sharing.

**Features:**

### 8. Stash Sync with Selective Import üì•

One-way sync from Stash with GraphQL filtering to reduce data transfer by 70-80%.

**Selective Sync Options:**

- **Scenes:** Rating only, Favorite only, O Counter only, combinations, or All
- **Performers:** Rating only, Favorite only, combinations, or All
- **Studios:** Rating only, Favorite only, combinations, or All
- **Tags:** Favorite only or All

**Performance:**

- GraphQL filtering at source reduces transfer dramatically
- Example: 21K total scenes ‚Üí ~4.5K rated scenes transferred
- Progress reporting with created/updated/checked counts
- Automatic cache invalidation after sync completes

**One-Way Policy:**

- Peek ‚Üí Local database only
- Does not modify Stash data
- Safe for testing without affecting Stash

---

- Sort by play count (ASC/DESC) - per-user values
- Correct ASC sorting (zeros first, non-zeros on last page)

**Filtering:**

- Filter by O counter min/max - per-user values
- Filter by play count min/max - per-user values

**Tracking Improvements:**

- Fixed playback delta calculations to prevent massive jumps
- Detect new viewing sessions (prevents counting resume as new session)
- Cap playback delta to reasonable values
- Better Stash sync logging

---

### 10. Entity Detail Page Fixes üêõ

Fixed critical filtering bugs on Performer, Studio, and Tag detail pages.

**Issues Fixed:**
