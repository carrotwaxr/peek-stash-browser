# Contributing to Peek Stash Browser

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Peek! This guide will help you get started with contributing code, documentation, and bug reports.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/peek-stash-browser.git
cd peek-stash-browser
git remote add upstream https://github.com/carrotwaxr/peek-stash-browser.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

Follow the [Development Setup](setup.md) guide to configure your local environment:

```bash
# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your Stash server settings
# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Create Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Code Contributions

### Before You Start

- **Check existing issues**: Look for open issues or create one to discuss your changes
- **Keep it focused**: One feature or fix per pull request
- **Follow conventions**: Match the existing code style and patterns

### Development Workflow

1. **Make your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend changes
   cd client && npm run dev

   # Backend changes
   cd server && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Write tests**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend tests
   cd client && npm test

   # Backend tests
   cd server && npm test
   ```

3. **Run linters**:
   ```bash
   # Frontend linting
   cd client && npm run lint

   # Backend linting
   cd server && npm run lint
   ```

4. **Test in browser**:
   - Open `http://localhost:6969`
   - Test your changes thoroughly
   - Check for console errors

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript/JavaScript

- **Use TypeScript strict mode** for backend code
- **Prefer functional components** with hooks for React
- **Use meaningful variable names**: `sceneId` not `sid`
- **Add JSDoc comments** for complex functions
- **Avoid `any` types** without justification

**Example**:
```typescript
/**
 * Translate Stash's internal Docker path to Peek's mount path
 * @param stashPath - Path reported by Stash API
 * @returns Translated path accessible by Peek
 */
export function translateStashPath(stashPath: string): string {
  const internalPath = process.env.STASH_INTERNAL_PATH || '/data';
  const peekPath = process.env.STASH_MEDIA_PATH || '/app/media';

  return stashPath.replace(internalPath, peekPath);
}
```

#### React Components

- **Props interface first**: Define prop types at top of file
- **Use hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`
- **Destructure props**: `const { scene, onPlay } = props`
- **Default exports**: Export component as default

**Example**:
```jsx
interface SceneCardProps {
  scene: Scene;
  onPlay: (sceneId: string) => void;
  className?: string;
}

const SceneCard: React.FC<SceneCardProps> = ({
  scene,
  onPlay,
  className = ''
}) => {
  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    onPlay(scene.id);
  }, [scene.id, onPlay]);

  return (
    <div className={`scene-card ${className}`} onClick={handleClick}>
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SceneCard;
```

#### CSS/Tailwind

- **Use Tailwind utilities** over custom CSS
- **Semantic class names** for custom components
- **Responsive by default**: Use responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`)
- **Theme variables**: Use theme colors and spacing

**Example**:
```jsx
<button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white rounded-md transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500">
  Click Me
</button>
```
