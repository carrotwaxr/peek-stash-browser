# Personalization

Customize Peek's navigation and layout to match how you browse your library.

## Landing Page Preference

Choose which page to land on after logging in, instead of always starting at Home.

### Setting Your Landing Page

1. Go to **Settings** → **Navigation**
2. Under **Landing Page After Login**, select your preferred page
3. Click **Save**

### Available Landing Pages

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Home** | Homepage with carousels (default) |
| **Scenes** | Scene browse page |
| **Performers** | Performer browse page |
| **Studios** | Studio browse page |
| **Tags** | Tag browse page |
| **Collections** | Collections/groups page |
| **Galleries** | Gallery browse page |
| **Images** | Image browse page |
| **Playlists** | Your playlists |
| **Recommended** | AI-recommended scenes |
| **Watch History** | Your viewing history |
| **User Stats** | Your statistics dashboard |

### Random Mode

For variety, enable **Random one of selected pages** to land on a different page each login:

1. Toggle on **Random one of selected pages**
2. Select 2 or more pages (checkboxes appear)
3. Click **Save**

Each time you log in, Peek randomly picks one of your selected pages.

### Priority Rules

Your landing page preference is used when you navigate directly to the login page. However, if you were redirected to login while trying to access a specific page (e.g., `/performers`), you'll be returned to that page instead of your preference.
